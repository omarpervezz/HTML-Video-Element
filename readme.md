Definition and Usage
The video tag is used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams.

The video tag contains one or more <source> tags with different video sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports.

The text between the video and video tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the video element.

There are three supported video formats in HTML: MP4, WebM, and OGG.
