<h3>Definition and Usage</h3>

The <strong>video</strong> tag is used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams.

The video tag contains one or more <strong>source</strong> tags with different video sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports.

The text between the <strong>video</strong> and video tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <strong>video</strong> element.

There are three supported <strong>video</strong> formats in HTML: MP4, WebM, and OGG.
